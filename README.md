I'm not a professional developer. It's a hobby. A hobby which started when I was 12 years old with Basic on my Commodore 116 and later Commodore 16/128/Amiga. I love challenges and to learn new things. So although much of my work would look trivial for professionals I enjoy the challenge and learning. This is also reflected in my programming. I'm not always looking for the practical or easy way - I like to learn and apply patterns and best practices. I like to keep things open for extension and changes. So whenever you find some peculiar code and think "why the hell is he doing this so complicated" it is probably because of this. Or maybe just because I was dumb and didn't know better ;)
